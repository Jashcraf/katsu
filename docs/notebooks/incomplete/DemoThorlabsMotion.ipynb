    "In addition to the Agilis rotation stage, ther are a number of motorized rotation stages that are convenient for accurate polarimetry. For example, the Thorlabs motorized rotation mount is an appealing option for 1\" optics. This device can be controlled via a USB connection to a computer using the Thorlabs [Kinesis](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=10285) Software or custom programs. Here we present an example of how one or more motors can be interfaced with via Python."
