Welcome to Katsu's documentation!
=================================
Katsu is a package for full Mueller and Stokes polarimetry in the laboratory, complete with Mueller calculus, polarimetric data reduction routines, and some simple classes for serial communication with rotation stages that enable polarimetry. Katsu was developed as a part of a NASA Space Technology Graduate Research Opportunity Visiting Technologist Experience at Subaru Telescope, with the aim of enhancing our understanding of instrumental polarization in astronomical telescopes.

Summary
