abstract = {All 16 elements of the Mueller matrix of an optical system (sample) can be encoded onto, hence can be retrieved from, a single detected signal using a class of photopolarimeters with modulated polarizing and analyzing optics. The general theory of operation of such polarimeters is presented. We also propose a specific new photopolarimeter whose polarizing and analyzing optics are modulated by synchronously rotating two quarter-wave retarders at angular speeds $\omega$ and 5$\omega$. When the light flux leaving such polarimeter is linearly detected, a periodic signal J$=$a0$+$∑n$=$112(an cos n$\omega$ft$+$bn sin n$\omega$ft) is generated, with fundamental frequency $\omega$f $=$ 2$\omega$. From the Fourier amplitudes a0, an, bn, to be measured by performing a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the signal ℐ, the 16 elements of the Mueller matrix are simply determined.},

abstract = {The dual-rotating-retarder configuration is one of the most common forms of the Mueller matrix polarimeter. I perform an optimization of this polarimeter configuration by minimizing the condition number of the system data reduction matrix. I find the optimum retardance for the rotating retarders to be 127{\textdegree}. If exactly 16 intensity measurements are used for a Mueller matrix calculation, a complex relationship exists between the condition number and the sizes of the angular increments of the two retarders. If many intensity measurements are made, thus overspecifying the calculation, I find broad optimal ranges of angular increments of the two retarders that yield essentially equal performance. Experimental results are given.},

Those factors are unique except for singular Mueller matrices. Based on this decomposition, the diattenuation and the retardance of a Mueller matrix can be defined and computed. Thus this algorithm is useful for performing data reduction upon experimentally determined Mueller matrices.},

For these missions to succeed, comprehensive and precise modeling is required to design and analyze suitable coronagraphs and their wavefront control systems. In this paper, we describe techniques for integrated modeling at scale that is, to the best of our knowledge, 1000 times faster than previously published works. We show how this capability has been used to validate performance and perform uncertainty quantification for the Roman Coronagraph instrument. Finally, we show how this modeling capacity may be necessary to design and build the next generation of space-based coronagraph instruments.},
